Description:
This project focuses on optimizing a supply chain system using linear programming techniques to minimize the total transportation cost of goods. The supply chain consists of three main components: factories, warehouses, and retail stores. Each segment of the supply chain has associated transportation costs. The project ensures that the supply constraints at factories and the demand constraints at retail stores are met efficiently.

The linear programming model employs decision variables representing the quantities of goods transported between factories, warehouses, and stores. Using these variables and the simplex method, the project calculates the optimal transportation plan that minimizes costs while fulfilling all constraints.

Features:

Implements a linear programming model for supply chain optimization.

Uses a solver to calculate the optimal solution, such as the simplex method.

Accounts for:

Factory capacities

Transportation costs between factories, warehouses, and stores

Demand at retail stores

How to Use:

The minimum transportation cost

Results:
The project successfully generates an optimal transportation plan that minimizes total costs while ensuring all supply and demand constraints are met. The linear programming model provides a scalable solution for supply chain problems of varying complexity.

Expectations:
This project serves as an educational tool for students and professionals interested in supply chain management and operations research. By studying the code and the underlying model, users can gain insights into:

The formulation of linear programming problems.

The application of optimization techniques like the simplex method.

Real-world supply chain scenarios and their solutions.

Users are encouraged to extend the project by:

Adding more layers to the supply chain.

Incorporating real-world data.

Exploring alternative solvers or algorithms.
